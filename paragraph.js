He was going to get her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.`,`Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience.

`,`Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed.

She had taken years to sculpt the perfect persona with the perfect look that she shared on Instagram.
